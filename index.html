                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>I have been a video game enthusiast ever since I was 6 years old, when my older brother received a Nintendo64 for Christmas that I was
                    (sometimes) allowed to play. My passion for programming, however, came much later. It wasn't until college when I took Introduction to Computer Science
                    that I realized how rewarding programming can be. In 2017 I graduated from The College of William and Mary with a B.S. in Psychology and
                    a minor in Computer Science. I had gone to college with the intent to become a therapist, but in the few years after I graduated, I started to
                    feel something pulling my away from psychology. In August of 2019 I decided I would take an online game development course as a hobby. At that
                    point I realized that my passion for programming and my desire to be part of the video game industry were what was pulling me away.
                    Since then I have worked on several small-scale projects in Unity as well as a long-term project that I am still working on today.</p>
