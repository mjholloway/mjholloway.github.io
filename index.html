                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>When I was six years old, my older brother introduced me to my first ever video game, The World Is Not Enough on Nintendo 64. We became obsessed, 
                        playing for hours every day until our mother stripped the controllers from our hands and banished us from the house. Eventually, I started playing 
                        other games too, devoting hundreds of hours to games like Majora’s Mask, Oblivion, and, more recently, Slay the Spire. When I took a few computer science
                        classes in college, I realized that games could become more than just a hobby for me. In August of 2019 I took an online course teaching the basics of 
                        game development in Unity, which helped me to create several small-scale projects, as well as my current long-term project, Fruitpocalypse 
                        (working title). I’ve discovered that I really enjoy figuring out how things work and how component parts can fit together to make a seamless whole. 
                        I’m so excited to be taking my interest in games and programming to the next level, and I can’t wait to start learning alongside other passionate gamers 
                        to create addictive games you can sink hours into--at least, before your mom tells you to go outside.</p>
