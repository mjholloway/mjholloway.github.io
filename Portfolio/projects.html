                                    <h4>Fruitpocalypse</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        This project started as a basic tower defense game I was building for practice. Eventually I had the idea of combining tower defense mechanics
                                        with deckbuilders, a genre I was (and still am) very interested in. This game is still in progress, and I hope to be able to actually
                                        make a full release at some point. I was able to use this project to learn pathfinding algorithms, practice using scripts that change
                                        the funcitonality of the editor itself, and implement other techniques I had learned across projects. One of the biggest challenges I faced
                                        with this project so far was implementing more complex coroutines than I had ever used before, primarily on handling the individual cards and
                                        dealing the initial hand, which greatly improved my confidence using coroutines when I finally got it working. I also made all the assets
                                        myself which helped me gain some experience with voxel art and blender.

                                    <h4>RPG Level</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        This game is a basic RPG level in which the player must get through guards to reach the other end of a village. The player can pick up health
                                        and several different types of weapons to help them defeat enemies. The player can level up by defeating enemies to increase their stats as
                                        well (although different weapons respond differently to the increased stats). I was able to learn about interfaces and events and utilize them
                                        both in this project. I also gained experience with a working save system and moving through different levels (or areas). I furthered my
                                        knowledge of animating assets and creating a basic AI system that can patrol, chase, and eventually return to patroling after losing the player.
                                        This was my first time trying to develop an actual leveling system with scaling stats and experience for defeating enemies.

                                    <p>
                                        This is a game in which the player explores a dark landscape infested by zombies. They must use the weapons provided and ammo they find along
                                        the way to survive. This was my first experience with first person shooters, and allowed me to gain experience using a first person controller.
                                        Additionally, I gained experience using ProBuilder to create buildings and ammunition assets, and used Unity's animation system to animate
                                        zombie assets and synchronize their animation with player damage. I gave the zombie enemies a basic AI using a state machine model.

                                        This is an on the rails shooter in which the player flies a ship through dangerous terrain and enemy ships and tries to survive while scoring
                                        the most points possible. It was one of my earliest projects that contained a full level. I was able to practice using waypoints to move an
                                        object throughout the scene, Unity's timeline feature to syncronize events, the terrain builder to create my own terrain, particle effects,
                                        and UI elements. I also gained experience importing and implementing assets from the Unity Asset Store.
